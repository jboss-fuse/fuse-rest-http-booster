= REST API Level 0 - Fuse Booster

The REST API Level 0 mission shows how to map business operations to a remote procedure call endpoint over HTTP by using a REST framework. This mission corresponds to Level 0 in the Richardson Maturity Model. 

By using this Fuse booster, you can quickly prototype and flexibly design a REST API.

This booster introduces the mechanics of interacting with a remote (exposed by Apache Camel) service using the HTTP protocol. 

Use this booster to:

* Execute an HTTP GET request on the `camel/greetings/{name}` endpoint by using the URL parameter `{name}`. The JSON-formatted response has a payload of `Hello, $name!` (where `$name` is replaced by the value of the URL parameter from the HTTP GET request).

* Browse the API's Swagger page.
                
== Deployment options

You can run this booster in the following modes:

* Single-node OpenShift cluster
* OpenShift Online at link:{launchURL}[]
* Standalone on your machine

The most effective way to use this booster is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

For more details about running this booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

IMPORTANT: This booster requires Java 8 JDK or later and Maven 3.3.x or later.


== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster

A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your booster there.

To deploy this booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted booster application (for example, `my_openshift/fuse-rest-http-booster`) :
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/fuse-rest-http-booster
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Popenshift
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `fuse-rest-http-booster` application has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, locate the URL for the `fuse-rest-http-booster` application. The URL uses this form:
`http://fuse-rest-http-booster-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io`.

. Click the URL to access the Greeting Service and then follow the instructions on that page.

=== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images
To deploy your booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Import base images in your newly created project (MY_PROJECT_NAME):
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc import-image {image-name-version} --from={image-registry}{image-prefix}{image-name-version} --confirm
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Popenshift -Djkube.generator.fromMode=istag -Djkube.generator.from=MY_PROJECT_NAME/{image-name-version}
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `fuse-rest-http-booster` application has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, locate the URL for the `fuse-rest-http-booster` application. The URL uses this form:
`http://fuse-rest-http-booster-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io`.

. Click the URL to access the greetings service application and then follow the instructions on that page.

== Running the booster on OpenShift Online

To deploy this booster directly to OpenShift Online when you create the project at link:{launchURL}[].

. Go to link:{launchURL}[].
. At the *Deployment step*, select *Use OpenShift Online*.
. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new *REST API Level 0* project by using the *Fuse* runtime.

NOTE: As part of the process of creating this booster, link:{launchURL}[] sets up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this booster. You can see the status of this deployment in your single-node OpenShift cluster or OpenShift Online web console.

== Running the booster standalone on your machine

To run this booster as a standalone project on your local machine:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Build the project:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ mvn clean package
----
. Run the services:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
. Go to link:http://localhost:8080[] and then follow the instructions on that page.
